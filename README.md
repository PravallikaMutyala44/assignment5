Python Basics: Student Marks & List Slicing

How to use a dictionary to look up student marks

How to slice and reverse a list

Program 1: Student Marks Lookup
A dictionary stores names and marks of students.

You enter a student’s name.

If the name exists, their marks are shown.

If not, it shows “Student not found”.

Example:
Enter the student's name: alice
Alice's marks: 50

Program 2: List Slicing and Reversing
A list of numbers from 1 to 10 is created.

The first 5 numbers are sliced from it.

These 5 numbers are then reversed.

Example:
Original list: [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
Extracted first five elements: [1,2,3,4,5]
Reversed extracted elements: [5,4,3,2,1]
